# PenTesting Notes

Resources for the various things, compiled together.<br>
Along with the HackTheBox raw notes which I took while solving challenges/ rooting machines.<br>
Use  [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) for the responsiveness. 

OR use  [obsidian-export](https://github.com/zoni/obsidian-export) to export the Obsidian Vault/Notes to regular markdown files.
